# react-native-rom-components

My customized components I use on most projects. 

## Installation

```sh
yarn add react-native-rom-components
```

## Usage

```js
import { View } from 'react-native-rom-components'

export const SomeComponent = () => (
  <View main='space-between' flex1>
    <View row cross='center'>
      ...
    </View>
  </View>
)

// We do not know why this component exists. We do not know why this was built. We do not know why this documentation is incomplete. We do not know when I'll be diligent enough to finish this. We only know that day is not this day.
```
